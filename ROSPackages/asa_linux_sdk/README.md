# ASA Linux SDK

1. You need to download the ASA Linux SDK to build the required Docker image. ([Sign the EULA to get access](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRx1PiClb2ndIsvKW1oq51RFUQ0Y0SUJUQjk5OEM0ODVBVUUwSFlQTEQySC4u)). After this you will receive the link to the SDK's .deb file via e-mail.

2. Copy the SDK in this directory. Make sure the file's name is `azure-spatial-anchors-2.7.0-release0005-Linux.deb`. Update lines 103 and 107 in the Dockerfile otherwise.
