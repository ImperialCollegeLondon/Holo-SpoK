This project includes a Unity app and a set of ROS packages for controlling Boston Dynamics' Spot using the Microsoft's HoloLens 2 and is primarily based on the paper [Holo-SpoK: Affordance-Aware Augmented Reality Control of Legged Manipulators](https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981989) ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKRCgP6j_PU)).

## Sections

Follow the instructions in the following README files to deploy the HL2 App first and then build the ROS packages required:

* [Unity App](UnityApp/README.md)
* [ROS Packages](ROSPackages/README.md)

## What are you using Holo-SpoK for?

We are very curious what you use Holo-SpoK for! Let us know about your projects, whether finished, ongoing, or first idea. This will helps us with our sponsors :)
